## Styling

The app uses styled-components for styling with:
- Modern gradient backgrounds
- Glassmorphism effects
- Responsive grid layouts
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. **New Contract Functions**: Add methods to `contractService.js`
2. **UI Components**: Create new styled components in `App.js`
3. **State Management**: Use React hooks for local state

### Testing

The app currently uses simulated contract calls for demo purposes. To integrate with real contracts:

1. Replace simulation calls with actual transaction signing
2. Integrate with Freighter wallet for transaction signing
3. Add proper error handling for network issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CORS Errors**: Make sure you're using the correct RPC URL
2. **Contract Not Found**: Verify the contract ID is correct
3. **Network Issues**: Check your internet connection and RPC endpoint

### Build Issues

```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
